/* Ever since you arrived at the Dojo, you wanted one of those Coding Dojo sweatshirts - maybe more than one.  Let's say they cost $20 (including tax), but friendly Josh gives a 9% discount if you buy two, a nice 19% discount if you buy three, or a sweet 35% discount if you buy four or more.  He only accepts cash and says he doesn't have coins, so you should round up to the nearest dollar.  Build a function sweatshirtPricing(num) that, given a number of sweatshirt, returns the cost. */
