/* First: Create threesFives() that adds values from 100 and 4000000 (inclusive) if that value is evenly divisible by 3 or 5, but not both.  Display the final sum in the console.

Second: Create betterThreeFives(start, end) that allows you to enter arbitrary start and end values for your range.  Think of threeFives() as betterThreeFives(100, 4000000). */
