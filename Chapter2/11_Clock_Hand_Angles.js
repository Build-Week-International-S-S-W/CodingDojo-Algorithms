/* Regardless of how hard a Dojo student works (and they should work hard), they need time now and then to unwind - like hands on a clock.  Traditional clocks are increasingly uncommon, but most can still read an analog clock's hands of hours, minutes, and seconds.  Create clockHandAngles(seconds) that, given a number of seconds since 12:00:00, prints the angle (in degrees) of the hour, minute, and second hands. For review: 360° form a full rotation.  For input of 3600 seconds (equivalent to 1:00:00), print "Hour hand: 30° - Minute hand: 0° - Second hand: 0°."  For an input parameter of 119730 (which is equivalent to 9:15:30 plus 24 hours!), you should log "Hour hand: 277.745° - Minute hand: 93° - Second hand: 180°."  Note: in the second example, the angle for the minute hand is not simply 90°; it has advanced a bit further, because of the additional 30 seconds in that minute so far.

Second: also calculate and print degrees for an additional "week hand" that rotates once each week. */
