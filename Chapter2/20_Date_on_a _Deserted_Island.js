/* After a particuliarly fabulous New Year's Eve party to end 2018, Eduardo wakes up to find himself stranded on a deserted island.  He misses home in Burbank, but at least now he can spend plenty of time outdoors - and you can't beat the commute!  To pass the time until he is rescued, he counts the sunrises.

1. Help Eduardo track what day of the week it is.  Create a weekdayName(weekdayNum) function that, given a number between 1 & 7, will console.log a string containing the day of the week for that number (given 1, log "Sunday").  Use a SWITCH statement.

2. Expand weekdayName() to create weekdayName2(dayNum) accepting numbers up to 365.  Return weekday as before, given number of days total.  "Sunday" still corresponds to 1.

3. Create a new function someDays() that calls weekdayName2() seventeen times, with randomly generated integers as high 365.  Log each result string.  If it is a weekday, add the phrase "Work hard!!!", and if it is a weekend day, add "Enjoy your day off!!!".

4. Build function monthName(monthNum) that, given a number from 1 to 12, returns a string containing the month for that number ("May" corresponds to 5).  Use an array, without loops.

5. Now expand monthName() to create monthToDays(monthNum), returning the number of days in the month, in the year 2019.  HINT: use a SWITCH statement for the days in each month.
