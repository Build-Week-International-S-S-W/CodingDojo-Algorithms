/* It's New Year's Eve, so let's play some dicec games!  It'll be fun.  What could go wrong?

1. Create function rollOne() to return a randomly selected integer between 1 and 6 (inclusive).

2. Second, create a function playFives(num), which should call rollOne() multiple times - 'num' times, in fact, where 'num' is input parameter to playFives(num).  Each time, it should print the value rollOne() returns, and if that roll value is 5, also print "That's good luck !".

3.
