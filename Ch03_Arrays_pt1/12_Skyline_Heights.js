/* Lovely Burbank has a breathtaking view of the Los Angeles skyline.  Let's say you are given an array with heights of consecutive buildings, starting closest to you and extending away.  Array [-1,7,3] would represent three buildings: first is actually out of view of street level, behind it is second at 7 stories high, and the third is 3 stories high (behind the 7-story).  You are situated at street level.  Return array containing heights of buildings you can see, in order.  Given [-1,1,1,7,3] return [1,7].  Given [0,4] return [4].  As always with challenges, do not use any built-in array functions such as unshift(). */
