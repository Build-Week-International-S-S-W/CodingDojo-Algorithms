/* For this challenge, we will look not only at the entire string provided, but also at the substrings within it.  Return the longest palindrome substring.  Given "what up, daddy-o?", return "dad".  Given "uh... not much", return "u".  Include spaces as well (i.e. be strist, as in previous challenge): given "Yikes! my favorite racecar erupted!", return "e racecar e".  Strings longer or shorter than complete words are OK.

Second: Re-solve the above problem, but ignore spaces, tabs, returns, capitalization, and punctuation.  Given "Hot puree eruption!", return "tpureeerupt". */
